    Today is gonna be the day

              D#sus4                  A#7sus4

That they're gonna throw it back to you

Fm7             G#

    By now you should've somehow

    D#sus4                A#7sus4

Realised what you gotta do

Feels the way I do about you now

    Backbeat the word is on the street

The way I do about you now

 

[Pre-chorus]

     C#                D#sus4            Fm

And all the roads we have to walk are winding

     C#                D#sus4                Fm

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

 C#              D#sus4

There are many things that I would

Fm7     D#sus4  G#

Like to say to you

       D#sus4      A#7sus4

But I don't know how

 

[Chorus]

         C#   Fm7 G#

Because maybe

        Fm7                  C#     Fm7 G#

You're gonna be the one that saves me

     Fm7  C#  Fm7 G#

And after all

           Fm7   C#  Fm7 G#  Fm7     G#

You're my wonderwall

But they'll never throw it back to you

Fm7            G#

    By now you should've somehow

    D#sus4                    A#7sus4

Realised what you're not to do

Fm7                  G#

I don't believe that anybody

D#sus4            A#7sus4

Feels the way I do

           Fm7 G#  D#sus4  A#7sus4
